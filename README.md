# dlrl-offtarget

Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning for off-target predictions <br>

Code Description: <br>
- *data/offtarget_createdataset.py* -> create the Bunch of the crispor data used for the experiments
- *data/offtargetcreateguideseqdataset.py* -> create the Bunch for the guide-seq experiments
- *experiments/offtargetmodelsexperiments_4x23.py* -> code to reproduce the experiments with 4 x 23 encoding
- *experiments/offtargetmodelsexperiments_8x23.py* -> code to reproduce the experiments with 8 x 23 encoding

Saved Models: <br>
- *saved_model_4x23* -> saved deep learning models for the predictions with 4x23 encoding. RF has a fixed random seed for the reproducibility of the results.
- *saved_model_crispr_8x23* -> saved deep learning models for the predictions with 8x23 encoding on CRISPOR data set. RF has a fixed random seed for the reproducibility of the results.
- *saved_model_guideseq_8x23* -> saved deep learning models for the predictions with 8x23 encoding on GUIDE-seq data set with transfer learning. RF has a fixed random seed for the reproducibility of the results.

Notebooks: <br>
- *notebooks/* -> notebook to used to run the experiments with "4x23" encoding and "8x23" encoding
